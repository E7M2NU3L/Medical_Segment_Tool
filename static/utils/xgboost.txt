XGBoost is a robust machine-learning algorithm that can help you understand your data and make better decisions.

XGBoost is an implementation of gradient-boosting decision trees. It has been used by data scientists and researchers worldwide to optimize their machine-learning models.

XGBoost is designed for speed, ease of use, and performance on large datasets. It does not require optimization of the parameters or tuning, which means that it can be used immediately after installation without any further configuration.

XGBoost Features
XGBoost is a widespread implementation of gradient boosting. Let’s discuss some features of XGBoost that make it so attractive.

XGBoost offers regularization, which allows you to control overfitting by introducing L1/L2 penalties on the weights and biases of each tree. This feature is not available in many other implementations of gradient boosting.
Another feature of XGBoost is its ability to handle sparse data sets using the weighted quantile sketch algorithm. This algorithm allows us to deal with non-zero entries in the feature matrix while retaining the same computational complexity as other algorithms like stochastic gradient descent.
XGBoost also has a block structure for parallel learning. It makes it easy to scale up on multicore machines or clusters. It also uses cache awareness, which helps reduce memory usage when training models with large datasets.
Finally, XGBoost offers out-of-core computing capabilities using disk-based data structures instead of in-memory ones during the computation phase.
XgBoost Formula
XgBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm for supervised learning. It's a highly efficient and scalable implementation of the boosting algorithm, with performance comparable to that of other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in most cases.

Following is the XGBoost formula:

Why XGBoost?

XGBoost is used for these two reasons: execution speed and model performance.

Execution speed is crucial because it's essential to working with large datasets. When you use XGBoost, there are no restrictions on the size of your dataset, so you can work with datasets that are larger than what would be possible with other algorithms.

Model performance is also essential because it allows you to create models that can perform better than other models. XGBoost has been compared to different algorithms such as random forest (RF), gradient boosting machines (GBM), and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT). These comparisons show that XGBoost outperforms these other algorithms in execution speed and model performance.

What is VGG
VGG stands for Visual Geometry Group; it is a standard deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with multiple layers. The “deep” refers to the number of layers with VGG-16 or VGG-19 consisting of 16 and 19 convolutional layers. The VGG architecture is the basis of ground-breaking object recognition models. Developed as a deep neural network, the VGGNet also surpasses baselines on many tasks and datasets beyond ImageNet. Moreover, it is now still one of the most popular image recognition architectures.
